# build_script
Empty Build Scripts (utilizing psake) to be added to dotnet core projects

Add Build folder, packages folder and build.ps1 to your project and make updates to build.ps1 and /Build/default.ps1 to conform to your project.

Will update as I find things to udpate.

This is for dotnet core, but can be tweaked for dotnet 5 - the dnx code is commented for the most part in /Build/default.ps1.
